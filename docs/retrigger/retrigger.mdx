A breif introduction to ReTrigger.

# How to use ReTrigger

ReTrigger is a highly versatile cog that allows server moderators and administrators to automatically perform many tasks based on regular expressions (regex) in chat. https://regex101.com/ Is suggested to test out any regular expression patterns you want before adding to the bot. Some commonly used tools include:

 - `\b` meaning word boundaries usually used at the beginning and end of the word or sentence to avoid triggering on `testing` when you only want `test`. (e.g. regex of `\bhello, world\b` will __only__ trigger if someone says exactly `hello, world` and not `hello, worlds`.)
 - `(?i)` at the beginning of the regex will ignore cases in the search so `test`, `Test`, and `TEST` are treated the same.
 - **Groups** can be utilized to pick specific parts of the pattern to be used later. Groups look like `(^I wanna be )([^.]*)` where everything inside the `()` brackets are a group. Groups are numbered 0 and up where 0 is the full pattern, 1 would be `I wanna be` and 2 would be `[^.]*]`. In this example anything after the words `I wanna be` is captured and can then be used in the response of the trigger by using `{2}` to signify group 2.
 - More useful special characters:
    - `^` signifies the start of a string.
    - `$` signifies the end of a string.
    - `?` 0 or 1 of the previous character or group.
    - `+` 1 or more of the previous character or group.
    - `*` 0 or more of the previous character or group.
    - `.` any character other than newline.
    - `|` **or** statement meaning this **or** that.

Special replacement parameters are as follows:
- `{p}` can be used to replace the bots default prefix in the message.
- `{pp}` can be used to list all the bots prefixes available on the server.
- `{count}` can be used to show the number of times a trigger has been triggered.
- `{nummatch}` can be used to replace the number of matches the pattern found.
- `{lenmessage}` can be used to replace the length of the message.
- `{lenmatch}` can be used to replace the length of the largest match found.

## Basic Commands

### Text

__Usage:__ `[p]retrigger text <name> <regex> <text>`
- `<name>` is the name of the trigger.
- `<regex>` the regex that will determine when to respond.
- `[delete_after]` Optionally have the text autodelete must include units e.g. 2m.
- `<text>` response of the trigger

This will send a message when the regex pattern supplied matches.

Text is the most basic response you can use and as such it has many options available to you.

Regex groups can be used to replace text in the response with a matched group just like the example above. Additionally other parameters are available such as `{author.name}`, `{message.jump_url}`, etc. [See Red's Customcom](https://red-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cog_customcom.html#context-parameters) for more examples.
