This page details some of the configuration options for the developer using Tags cog.

These settings can be applied with the `[p]tagset` group command and viewed with `[p]tagset settings`.

## Custom Blocks

For developers who wish to add custom blocks to the TagScript engine, Tags has built in commands to add blocks without editing the cog.

Start off with the `[p]tagset block add <name> <code>` comaand. The code passed must subclass TagScriptEngine.Block and return the subclass. Here’s an example of a block that returns a random duck image

```py
[p]tagset block add duck ```py
import aiohttp

class RandomDuck(tse.Block):
    accepted_names = ("duck",)

    async def process(self, ctx: tse.Context):
        async with aiotthp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get("https://random-d.uk/api/v2/random") as r:
                data = await r.json()
        return data["url"]

return RandomDuck
```

When a user runs a tag with a `{duck}` block, it will return a random duck image such as

```py
[p]tag + randomduck {duck}
[p]randomduck
# https://random-d.uk/api/100.jpg
```

One thing to note in the above example is that the `RandomDuck.process` method is asynchronous. By default, the Tags interpreter doesn’t support asynchronous blocks, but asynchronous parsing can be enabled as detailed in [Asynchronous Interpreter](/docs/custom-commands/dev/asynchronous-interpreter).

Custom blocks can be viewed with `[p]tagset block list` or [p]tagset block show <block_name>. They can be deleted with `[p]tagset block remove <block_name>`, and edited by simple re-adding a block with the same name.

## Custom Block Environment

The following global scope variables are available when compiling the custom block code:

Name | Value
-----|------
`tse` | The TagScriptEngine module
`asyncio` | The standard library asyncio module.
`bot` | The bot object.
`tags` | The Tags cog object

## Asynchronous Interpreter

By default, the Tags interpreter only supports synchronous blocks and methods. However, in order to support custom blocks with asynchronous code and avoid blocking tags, bot owners can enable the asynchronous interpreter with `[p]tagset async True`. Synchronous blocks will still parse normally through the interpreter.

## Dot Parameter

TagScript block parsing can be changed to identify parameters with . rather than `()`. This “dot-parameter” style parsing is similar to other formatting parsers, such as the one used in **CustomCom**. Enabling this with `[p]tagset dotparam` will have the following behavior:

```py
# dot parameter enabled
{server.name}
# Melon's Lounge

# dot parameter disabled
{server(name)}
# Melon's Lounge
```
