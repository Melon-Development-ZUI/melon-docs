This page shows the actions and conditions for warden.

## Conditions

* `message-matches-any`  
Is `true` if any of the patterns that you list are found in the message's content. This kind of searching might be inconvenient in certain use cases: if you prefer to look for whole words instead see the condition `message-contains-word`  <br />
**Accepts:** A list of patterns. Patterns can make use of wildcards such as `*` and `?`  <br />
**Context:** `message`  <br />
**Example:**  

```yaml
- message-matches-any: ["cat"] # This will only match exactly this word
# I like cats -> Is false
# cat -> Is true
# cats -> Is false
- message-matches-any: ["*cat*"] # The wildcard "*" represents any multiple characters
# I like cats -> Is true
# I like cat -> Is true
# I like c4t -> Is false
- message-matches-any: ["*c?t*"] # The wildcard "?" represents any single character
# I like cats -> Is true
# I like cat -> Is true
# I like c4t -> Is true
# xxxxcatxxxx -> Is true
```

* `message-matches-regex`  <br />
Is `true` if the regex returns a match against the message's content  <br />
**Accepts:** A string representing a regular expression. Remember that `\` must be escaped: turn all `\` characters to `\\` when entering the rule.  <br />

### Variables related actions

* `var-assign`  <br />
Assigns a value to a variable.  

```yaml
- var-assign: [my_var, 123]
- var-assign:
    var_name: my_var
    value: 123
    evaluate: false # (optional, if true any context variable contained in value will be evaluated)
# The variable my_var will be equal to 123
```

* `var-assign-random`  <br />
Assigns a random value to a variable, picking one from a list of choices. Supports weighted choices  

```yaml
# A simple, non-weighted choice
- var-assign-random: [my_var, [apple, banana, pear]]
- var-assign-random:
    var_name: my_var
    choices: [apple, banana, pear]
    evaluate: false # (optional, if true any context variable contained in value will be evaluated)
# A weighted choice
- var-assign-random:
    var_name: my_var
    choices:
       apple: 10
       banana: 1
       pear: 2
    evaluate: false # (optional, if true any context variable contained in value will be evaluated)
```

* `var-split`  <br />
Splits a variable into parts, using separator as the delimiter, and assigns the parts to different variables. If there are more parts than provided variables, the remaining parts will be discarded. If there are fewer parts than provided variables, an empty string will be assigned to the remaining variables. Maximum splits can be specified, by default there is no limit. 

```yaml
- var-assign: [fruit, "apple pear banana tomato"]
# fruit1 will contain "apple", fruit2 "pear", etc. Splits are done left to right.
- var-split: [fruit, " ", [fruit1, fruit2, fruit3, fruit4]]
# As before fruit1 will contain "apple", fruit2 "pear" but the remaining parts will be lost
- var-split: [fruit, " ", [fruit1, fruit2]]
# A max_split of 1 is specified, fruit1 will still be "apple", but fruit2 will be "pear banana tomato"
- var-split: [fruit, " ", [fruit1, fruit2], 1]
- compare: ["$fruit2", "==", "pear banana tomato"] # True!
# Same as before, but fruit3 will be an empty string: only one split has been done, and there's nothing left to assign to fruit3.
- var-split: [fruit, " ", [fruit1, fruit2, fruit3], 1]
- compare: ["$fruit1", "==", "apple"] # True!
- compare: ["$fruit3", "==", ""] # True!
# Long form:
- var-split:
    var_name: fruit
    separator: " "
    split_into: [fruit1, fruit2, fruit3]
    max_split: 1 # (optional)
```

* `var-slice`  <br />
Slices a variable according to the indices (the position of the characters) that are being passed. If a variable name is passed with slice_into the original variable will be left untouched. The optional parameter step, found in Python's string slicing, can also be passed. Remember than indices start from 0, not 1.

```yaml
- var-assign: [my_var, "abcdefgh"]
- var-slice: [my_var, 0, 2, sliced]
- compare: ["$sliced", "==", "ab"] # True!
- var-slice: [my_var, 0, 4]
- compare: ["$my_var", "==", "abcd"] # True!
- var-assign: [my_var, "abcdefgh"]
# Long form
- var-slice:
    var_name: my_var

    step: 2
- compare: ["$sliced", "==", "aceg"] # True!
```

* `var-replace`  <br />
Modifies a variable with all the occurrences of strings replaced by substring. Strings can be a single value or a list of values.

```yaml
- var-assign: [my_var, "I like apples a lot"]
- var-replace: [my_var, a, 4]
- compare: ["$sliced", "==", "I like 4pples 4 lot"] # True!
- var-assign: [my_var, "I like apples a lot"]
- var-replace: [my_var, [a, p], x]
- compare: ["$sliced", "==", "I like xxxles x lot"] # True!
# Long form
- var-replace:
    var_name: my_var
    strings: a # Can also be a list, as shown above
    substring: b
```

* `var-transform`  <br />
Modifies a variable depending on the "operation" that it's being requested. Supported operations are capitalize, lowercase, reverse, uppercase, title.

```yaml
- var-assign: [my_var, "I like apples A LOT"]
