Defender is a big and complex cog but I promise that if you hang in there you could <i>just</i> make it ;)

It is recommended that you read this page and then head to the configuration guilde.

<h3> What is Defender </h3>

Defender is what you could best be defined as a suite of tools aimed primarily at rendering your Discord community 
safe and secure.

Functionalities are splitted in modles:

* `Auto modules`, which are automated moderation and monitoring functionalities.
* `Manual modules`, which are tools that you can use in time of need.

Each module is <i>optional</i>, meaning that you can decide to only enable specific parts of Defender.

Despite being designed to counter serious threats Defender can also be a very valuable tool for smaller 
communities with less traffic.
