Defender is a big and complex cog but I promise that if you hang in there you could <i>just</i> make it ;)

It is recommended that you read this page and then head to the configuration guilde.

### What is Defender

Defender is what you could best be defined as a suite of tools aimed primarily at rendering your Discord community 
safe and secure.

Functionalities are splitted in modles:

* `Auto modules`, which are automated moderation and monitoring functionalities.
* `Manual modules`, which are tools that you can use in time of need.

Each module is <i>optional</i>, meaning that you can decide to only enable specific parts of Defender.

Despite being designed to counter serious threats Defender can also be a very valuable tool for smaller 
communities with less traffic.

### Ranks

Defender categorizes your userbase into different ranks. They range from <b>Rank 1 </b>, your most trusted users until 
<b>Rank 4</b>, new users with little to no activity in your server. <br />
Thanks to this system, you are able to set up each different module so that they only target people below a certain rank, 
meaning that your regular users will be safe from the many safety measures that Defender offers. <br />
A regular user will only be able to rank up until Rank 2. Rank 1 is considered a special rank that can only be attained 
through designed roles or by being a staff member. <br /> <br />

### Emergency mode

`Emergency mode` is a feature meant to help when nobody in your staff team is online; it can be 
triggered by the `Alert` manual module described above. <br />
During configuration you can choose to assign a number of manual modules to emergency mode. <br />
After your designated helper roles issue a `[p]alert` / `[p]staff` Defender will wait for a time for your staff team to take any 
action in the server. <br /> 
In case tiyr staff team doesn't respond in X minutes, emergency mode will be triggered. Users 
with the helper roles be able to use the emergency modules, and depending on which ones you chose, they'll 
be able to deal with the threat by themselves. <br />
Defender will periodically check for activity by your staff team and upon detecting it, it will disable emergency mode. <br /> <br />

### Ouick actions

It is possible to act on Defender's standard notifications by reacting on them. It is also possible to make Warden rules that support this. <br />
