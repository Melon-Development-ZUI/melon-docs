* ## <b> About the Developer </b>
That's me! I'm `inthedark.org#0666 (759180080328081450)`, and I've been moderating Discord servers for over 4 years now and have been developing bots for over 3 years now, I've been programming for over 6 years, Coding was possible for me because of websites like [google](https://www.google.com) and documentation sites and some basic knowledge I got in my College. I own a couple of servers too. I moderate/manage a few more servers too, so just hit me up if you wanna join them or something.
